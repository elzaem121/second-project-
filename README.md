# Weather-Journal App Project

This is my second project, and I hope to be successful in using the tools that I learned

## Overview

I created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI.
I wrote comments to make the code more readable.
I used extention on the URL (&units=metric) to get the Celsius Temperature.

// How to use //

All you should do is write the ZIP code of the city

You can write your feelings if you want.

The application will show you.

the name of the city.
the temperature.
the date.
description of weather.
your feelings.
